- **Classification**: Multinomial Naive Bayes with ensemble options
- **Rule Engine**: Pattern-based categorization for high-confidence matches
- **Feedback System**: User corrections improve model accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Probabilistic outputs for transparency

## Key Features Implemented

### Transaction Management
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, amounts, categories, accounts, status
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficiently process multiple transactions
- **Export Options**: CSV and formatted Excel with summaries
- **Import Capability**: CSV upload for manual transaction entry
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Income/expense tracking, category breakdowns

### ML Categorization
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines ML models with rule-based patterns
- **Auto-Categorization**: Configurable confidence thresholds
- **Batch Processing**: Handle large transaction volumes
- **Continuous Learning**: Feedback loop improves accuracy over time
- **Performance Metrics**: Track model accuracy and usage statistics

### Category Management
- **Custom Categories**: User-defined categories with rules
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Parent-child category relationships
- **Auto-Rules**: Pattern matching for automatic categorization
- **Bulk Management**: Activate/deactivate multiple categories

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexing**: Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large datasets
3. **Batch Operations**: Reduced database round trips
4. **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for session management
5. **Async Processing**: Background tasks for heavy operations

## Security Measures

1. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth with refresh mechanism
2. **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt
3. **Data Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
4. **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas validate all inputs
5. **SQL Injection Prevention**: SQLAlchemy ORM protects against injections
6. **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin access

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Authentication flow (registration, login, refresh)
- Transaction CRUD operations
- ML categorization accuracy
- Category rule matching
- Export/import functionality

### Integration Tests
- Plaid API integration
- Transaction categorization pipeline
- Bulk operations performance
- Export file generation

### Load Tests
- Transaction listing with large datasets
- Bulk categorization performance
- Concurrent user handling
- Export generation under load

## Deployment Readiness

### Environment Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 7+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Required Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secure-random-key>
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=<plaid-client-id>
PLAID_SECRET=<plaid-secret>
PLAID_ENV=sandbox|development|production
```

### ML Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-ml.txt
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. ML model requires minimum 100 labeled transactions for training
2. Export files are generated synchronously (could impact performance)
3. Category rules are text-based (no complex logic operators yet)

### Recommended Enhancements
1. **Advanced ML Models**: Implement ensemble methods and deep learning
2. **Async Export**: Move large exports to background jobs
3. **Recurring Transaction Detection**: Identify and predict recurring payments
4. **Multi-Currency Support**: Handle international transactions
5. **Budget Tracking**: Add budget creation and monitoring
6. **Financial Reports**: Generate P&L, balance sheets, cash flow statements

## Migration & Upgrade Path

### Database Migrations
```bash
# Initialize migrations
alembic init alembic

# Create migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Phase 2 implementation"

# Apply migrations
