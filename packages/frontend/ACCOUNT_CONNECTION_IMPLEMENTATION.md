│   ├── accounts/
│   │   └── connection-status.tsx   # Account connection overview
│   └── ui/
│       └── toast.tsx               # Notification system
├── hooks/

    ├── accounts/
    │   └── page.tsx                # Main accounts page
    └── dashboard/
        └── page.tsx                # Updated dashboard
```

### Data Flow

1. **Account Connection Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks "Connect Account" 
   → Request link token from backend
   → Initialize Plaid Link with token
   → User completes bank authentication
   → Receive public token from Plaid
   → Exchange public token with backend
   → Backend stores access token and fetches accounts
   → Frontend updates account list
   → Show success notification
   ```

2. **Account Synchronization**:
   ```
   User clicks "Sync" 
   → Request sync from backend API
   → Backend fetches latest data from Plaid
   → Return updated account information
   → Frontend updates account display
   → Show sync status notification
   ```

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/v1/plaid/create-link-token` - Get Plaid Link token
- `POST /api/v1/plaid/exchange-public-token` - Exchange public token
- `GET /api/v1/accounts` - List user accounts
- `DELETE /api/v1/accounts/{id}` - Remove account
- `POST /api/v1/plaid/sync-transactions` - Sync transactions
- `GET /api/v1/plaid/institutions/{id}` - Get institution details

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Plaid Link Integration
- ✅ Dynamic script loading for Plaid Link
- ✅ Link token management with expiration handling
- ✅ Public token exchange with backend
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling for connection failures
- ✅ Loading states during connection process

### 2. Account Management
- ✅ List all connected accounts with real-time balances
- ✅ Display institution logos and names
- ✅ Show account types, subtypes, and masked numbers
- ✅ Connection status indicators (active/inactive)
- ✅ Last sync timestamp display
- ✅ Account removal with confirmation

### 3. Real-time Balance Display
- ✅ Current balance with proper formatting
- ✅ Available balance (where applicable)
- ✅ Credit limit display for credit accounts
- ✅ Color-coded balance indicators
- ✅ Balance visibility toggle

### 4. Account Sync Functionality
- ✅ Individual account synchronization
- ✅ Bulk account synchronization
- ✅ Loading indicators during sync
- ✅ Success/error notifications
- ✅ Transaction count updates

### 5. Error Handling
- ✅ Connection timeout handling
- ✅ Invalid token error recovery
- ✅ Network failure graceful degradation
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Retry mechanisms

### 6. User Experience
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- ✅ Loading states and progress indicators
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Accessible UI with proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Intuitive navigation and actions

## State Management

### Account State
- Uses React Query for server state management
- Implements optimistic updates for better UX
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

### UI State
- Local state for component interactions
- Toast provider for global notifications
- Loading states managed per operation
- Form state for connection flows

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Security**
   - Link tokens have short expiration times
   - Public tokens are immediately exchanged
   - No sensitive data stored in frontend state
   - API calls include proper authentication headers

2. **Data Protection**
   - Account numbers are masked in UI
   - Balance visibility can be toggled
   - Secure HTTPS communication required
   - No account credentials stored locally

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Plaid Link script loaded dynamically
   - Components lazy-loaded where appropriate
   - API calls optimized with React Query caching

2. **Rendering Optimization**
   - Memoized components for expensive renders
   - Virtualized lists for large account datasets
   - Optimistic updates for immediate feedback

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Mobile Safari and Chrome
- Firefox and Edge latest versions
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

## Development Setup

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env.local
   # Update NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENV
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install react-plaid-link
   ```

3. **Backend Requirements**
   - Backend API must be running on configured URL
   - Plaid integration must be properly configured
   - Authentication system must be active

- ✅ Mobile responsive design

## Deployment Notes

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENV to 'production' for live deployment
   - Configure proper API_URL for production backend
   - Enable HTTPS for production environment

2. **CDN Considerations**
   - Plaid Link script loaded from CDN
   - Institution logos served from Plaid/external sources
   - Ensure CSP allows external script loading

- [ ] Add comprehensive logging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Plaid Link Not Loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Plaid script CDN accessibility
   - Check browser console for script errors

2. **Token Exchange Failures**
   - Verify backend API is running
   - Check API endpoint configuration
   - Validate authentication headers

3. **Account Sync Issues**
   - Check backend Plaid configuration
   - Verify account tokens are still valid
   - Check for API rate limiting

### Debug Information
- Enable React Query DevTools in development
- Check browser network tab for API calls
- Monitor backend logs for Plaid API errors
- Use Plaid Link's onEvent callback for debugging

## Conclusion
