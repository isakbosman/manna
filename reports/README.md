# Reports

This is where the reports go. This basically is where we store the owner packages:

## The Owner Package:
•	P&L (YTD + vs prior month), Balance Sheet, simple Cash Flow
•	KPIs: Effective hourly rate, utilization %, AR aging, project margin, cash runway
•	1-page narrative: highlights, risks, actions
