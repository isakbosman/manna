Based on the research and your project context, here's my recommended agent combination:

Core Specialized Agents

1. transaction-processor - Downloads and classifies transactions from Plaid
2. reconciliation-specialist - Matches transactions across accounts and identifies discrepancies
3. financial-reporter - Generates P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow statements
4. kpi-analyst - Tracks utilization, margins, runway, and other KPIs
5. narrative-writer - Creates executive summaries with insights and action items
6. compliance-auditor - Ensures data accuracy and maintains audit trails
7. workflow-coordinator - Orchestrates weekly/monthly/yearly workflows

Workflow Structure

Weekly Workflow:

- Transaction download and classification
- Quick reconciliation check
- Cash position update
- KPI snapshot

Monthly Workflow:

- Full transaction reconciliation
- P&L and Balance Sheet generation
- KPI analysis with trend comparison
- Executive narrative summary
- AR aging review

Yearly Workflow:

- Annual financial statements
- Tax preparation data
- Comprehensive KPI analysis
- Strategic planning inputs

Before creating the agents, I have some clarifying questions:

1. Data Sources: Besides Plaid, do you plan to integrate other data sources (invoicing systems, expense tools, payroll)?
2. Business Type: Is this for a consulting/services business, e-commerce, or mixed? This affects the KPIs and report formats.
3. Automation Level: Should workflows run automatically on schedule, or be manually triggered?
4. Report Recipients: Will reports go to owners only, or also investors, lenders, or tax preparers?
5. Compliance Requirements: Any specific accounting standards (GAAP, cash basis) or regulatory requirements?
