## 2. Detailed Security Findings

### 2.1 Authentication & Authorization ✅ STRONG

**Status:** SECURE with minor recommendations

**Implemented Security Measures:**
- JWT-based authentication with access/refresh token pattern
- Bcrypt for password hashing with proper cost factors
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Session management through Redis
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Password strength validation

**Code Quality:**
```python
# Proper password hashing implementation
def hash_password(password: str) -> str:
    return pwd_context.hash(password)

# Strong password validation
def validate_password_strength(password: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    if len(password) < settings.password_min_length:
        return False, f"Password must be at least {settings.password_min_length} characters long"
    # ... additional strength checks
```

**Minor Issues:**
- Email verification not enforced on all endpoints (LOW)
- Consider implementing MFA for admin accounts (INFO)

### 2.2 Input Validation & Sanitization ✅ GOOD

**Status:** WELL IMPLEMENTED

**Strengths:**
- Pydantic models for comprehensive input validation
- SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection
- Proper parameterized queries throughout codebase
- UUID validation for resource access

**Potential XSS Issues (MEDIUM):**
```typescript
// Found in use-toast.ts - Direct innerHTML usage
toastElement.innerHTML = `
    <div class="font-medium">${title}</div>
    ${description ? `<div class="text-sm mt-1 opacity-90">${description}</div>` : ''}
`
```
**Recommendation:** Sanitize user input or use textContent instead of innerHTML.

### 2.3 API Security ✅ GOOD

**Status:** SECURE with recommendations

**Implemented:**
- CORS properly configured with environment-specific origins
- Rate limiting middleware with Redis backend
- Request ID tracking for audit trails
- Comprehensive error handling without information disclosure
- API versioning implemented

**Rate Limiting Implementation:**
```python
class RateLimitMiddleware:
    def __init__(self, app, requests_per_minute: int = 60, requests_per_hour: int = 1000):
        # Proper implementation with Redis backing
```

### 2.4 Database Security ✅ STRONG

**Status:** WELL SECURED

**Strengths:**
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities found
- Proper use of SQLAlchemy ORM
- Database connections properly managed
- User data isolation through proper filtering
- Audit logging implemented

**Example of secure query pattern:**
```python
# Proper parameterized query with user isolation
transaction = db.query(Transaction).join(Account).filter(
    and_(Transaction.id == transaction_id, Account.user_id == current_user.id)
).first()
```

### 2.5 Dependency Vulnerabilities ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Status:** REQUIRES ATTENTION

**Python Dependencies (35 vulnerabilities found):**
From safety scan, notable findings:
- urllib3: SSRF vulnerability (affects HTTP requests)
- h11: HTTP request smuggling potential
- ecdsa: Minerva attack vulnerability (CVE-2024-23342)

**JavaScript Dependencies:** ✅ CLEAN
- No vulnerabilities detected in NPM audit

**Recommendations:**
1. Update urllib3 to version 2.5.0 or later
2. Review h11 usage and update if possible
3. Consider alternatives to python-ecdsa for cryptographic operations

### 2.6 Container Security ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Status:** GOOD with improvements needed

**Strengths:**
- Non-root user implementation
- Multi-stage builds (where applicable)
- Proper base image selection (python:3.11-slim, node:18-alpine)

**Issues Found:**
```dockerfile
# Backend Dockerfile - Hardcoded bind to all interfaces
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```
**Bandit Finding:** B104 - Possible binding to all interfaces (MEDIUM)

**Recommendations:**
1. Bind to specific interface in production
2. Implement container scanning in CI/CD pipeline
3. Add security context constraints

### 2.7 Secrets Management ✅ GOOD

**Status:** PROPERLY HANDLED

**Strengths:**
- Environment variables used for all sensitive data
- .env files properly gitignored and protected
- No hardcoded secrets found in codebase
- Validation for production secret keys

**Minor Issues from Bandit:**
- False positives on "bearer" token type strings (LOW)
- Temporary file usage in ML module (MEDIUM)

### 2.8 Infrastructure Security

**Docker Compose Analysis:**
```yaml
# SECURITY ISSUE: Default credentials
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: manna  # Should use secrets
  POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust  # Insecure
```

**Issues:**
1. Default database credentials (MEDIUM)
2. Trust authentication method (HIGH in production)
3. No network segmentation defined

### 2.9 Error Handling & Logging ✅ STRONG

**Status:** WELL IMPLEMENTED

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive error handling middleware
- No sensitive information in error responses
- Structured logging with request tracking
- Proper audit trails for financial operations
