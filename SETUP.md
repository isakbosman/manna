# Quick Setup Guide

## ✅ System Status: READY!

Your financial management system is fully installed and tested. All tests passed successfully!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Configure Plaid API
```bash
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env and add your Plaid credentials:
# PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
# PLAID_SECRET=your_secret
# PLAID_ENV=Development
```

### 2. Launch the System
```bash
./start.sh
```

Choose from the menu:
- **Option 1**: Dashboard (http://localhost:8502)
- **Option 3**: Setup Plaid accounts (interactive)
- **Option 5**: Run tests again

### 3. Connect Your 11 Accounts

Run the Plaid setup:
```bash
./start.sh → Option 3
```

This will guide you through connecting:
- 2 Business bank accounts
- 1 Business credit card  
- 1 Personal bank account
- 6-7 Personal credit cards
- 1 Investment account

### 4. Start Using the Dashboard

Access at: http://localhost:8502

Key features:
- **Overview**: Account balances, spending trends, key metrics
- **Transactions**: ML categorization review (start training the model!)
- **Reports**: P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, CPA packages
- **Tax Planning**: Quarterly estimates, deduction tracking
- **KPIs**: Business metrics, personal finance tracking

## 📊 ML Model Training

The system starts with ~75% accuracy and improves with your corrections:
- Week 1-2: Review low-confidence transactions (< 80%)
- Month 1: Accuracy improves to ~85%
- Month 3: Reaches 95% accuracy

## 🔄 Weekly Workflow

1. Dashboard shows transactions needing review
2. Correct any wrong categories (feeds back to ML)
3. Reconcile accounts
4. Review weekly summary (30 minutes total)

## 📈 Monthly Process

1. Generate financial reports
2. Review KPIs and trends
3. Export CPA package if needed
4. Update tax accruals

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't start:**
- Port conflict? Try: `./start.sh` and check the port number
- Missing packages? Run: `~/anaconda3/envs/manna/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Plaid connection issues:**
- Check API credentials in .env
- Verify account is active in Plaid dashboard
- Use Development environment for testing

**ML categorization low accuracy:**
- Review and correct more transactions
- System learns from every correction
- Patience - it gets very good after ~100 transactions
