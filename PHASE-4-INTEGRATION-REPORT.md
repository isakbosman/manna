## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Status |

| API Contract Mismatch | Medium | High | TypeScript generation from OpenAPI | üîÑ Active |
| Test Coverage Gap | Low | Medium | Incremental testing approach | üîÑ Active |
| WebSocket Scalability | Medium | High | Connection pooling, Redis pub/sub | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Security Vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Early scanning, continuous monitoring | ‚è≥ Planned |
| Performance Degradation | Medium | Medium | Caching, query optimization | ‚è≥ Planned |

### Contingency Plans

1. **If integration delayed**: Deploy with mock data, progressive rollout
2. **If coverage below 80%**: Focus on critical paths, defer edge cases
3. **If security issues found**: Hotfix process, rollback capability
4. **If performance issues**: Implement caching, optimize queries

## Conclusion

Phase 4 integration is progressing according to the orchestrated workflow. The parallel execution strategy is enabling efficient progress across multiple fronts. Key infrastructure components (API client, WebSocket server, test framework) have been successfully implemented, providing a solid foundation for the remaining integration work.

The coordinated agent approach is proving effective, with clear task ownership and handoff protocols established. With continued focus on the execution plan, all Phase 4 objectives and success metrics are achievable within the allocated timeline.

**Overall Phase 4 Progress: 35%**
