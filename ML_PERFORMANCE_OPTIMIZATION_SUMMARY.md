## 🧪 A/B Testing Strategy

### Gradual Rollout Plan
1. **Phase 1**: 10% traffic → Optimized service (Initial validation)
2. **Phase 2**: 25% traffic → Monitor for 24 hours
3. **Phase 3**: 50% traffic → Collect user feedback  
4. **Phase 4**: 75% traffic → Performance validation
5. **Phase 5**: 100% traffic → Full deployment

### Rollout Criteria
- **Minimum samples**: 1,000 predictions per phase
- **Error rate**: < 2% difference between services
- **Performance improvement**: ≥ 10% response time improvement
